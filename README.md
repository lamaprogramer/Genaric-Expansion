# Genaric-Expansion
Minecraft Modpack that I am developing, any feadback on balance changes or bugs will be greatly apreceated

## Disclaimer:
Currently in experimental stages and none of the mods are final

Not recomended to use on an old and/or weak computer
# Setup
## Curently only supports GDlauncher, I am working on adding support for other launchers

## The setup guide asumes you already know how to use your launcher of choise and how to navagate your computer

### GDlauncher:

1: Download the zip file from the repo

2: Enter GDlauncher and create a new instance

3: On the top-right, select Import Zip

4: Select the location of your zip file

5: Select the name of your instance

6: Wait for the instance to set everything up (downloadding the mods may take a minute or two)

# Post Setup

It is recomended to alocate 5-6 gigabytes to the pack

After entering the game, you should adjust the settings to your liking

after creating a world, there will be some lag as the world first starts generating, it should die down ater 15-45 seconds depending on your computer

Have Fun!

# ToDo
