# Post Setup

It is recomended to alocate 5-6 gigabytes to the pack

After entering the game, you should adjust the settings to your liking

after creating a world, there will be some lag as the world first starts generating, it should die down ater 15-45 seconds depending on your computer

Have Fun!
